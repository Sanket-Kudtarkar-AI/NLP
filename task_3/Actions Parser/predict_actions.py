imperative_parser("Bring me a glass of water.\
Don’t ever touch my phone.\
Give me a pen and a pencil.\
Play with intensity and courage.\
Remember me when we are parted.\
Never forget the person who loves you.\
Take a step and don’t move.\
Don’t be excited about everything without reason.\
Don’t rush or you will fall.\
Read a lot to improve your writing skill.\
Write whenever you get a chance.\
Don’t stay out at night.\
Please open the door quickly.\
Have a cup of cappuccino.\
You wash your hand first and then eat.\
Kindly bring the book to me.\
Please forgive my meticulousness but you have spelled it wrong.\
Don’t ever call me a loser.\
Watch your step before taking it.\
Please grant me a loan.")
